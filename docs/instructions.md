# Creating a Quiz Generator (Overview)

Generating questions from a given paragraph is a challenging task that involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The following steps can be used to build a Quiz generator.

1. **Preprocessing:** Start by preprocessing the input paragraph. This typically involves *__tokenization__*, which breaks the paragraph into individual words or sentences. You may also need to handle punctuation, lowercase the text, and remove any irrelevant or stop words.

2. **Sentence Segmentation:**  If the input paragraph is not already divided into sentences, you'll need to segment it into sentences. This is necessary because most questions are formed based on sentence-level information.
3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Assign each word in the sentences its corresponding part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). POS tagging helps identify grammatical patterns and structure in the sentences, which can be useful for generating questions.

4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Apply NER to identify and categorize named entities in the text, such as people, organizations, locations, or dates. Recognizing named entities can assist in generating more specific questions.

5. **Parsing and Dependency Parsing:**  Parse the sentences to analyze the grammatical structure and dependencies between words. Dependency parsing helps identify relationships between words and can guide question generation.

6. **Question Generation Techniques:** There are several approaches to generating questions from a given sentence. Here are a few common techniques:
    - Wh questions: Identify the main subject, verb, and object in a sentence and generate questions by replacing one of them with a wh-word (e.g., who, what, when, where, why, how).
    - Reversing word order: Reverse the word order in a sentence to create a question (e.g., "You went to the store" becomes "Did you go to the store?").
    - Yes/No questions: Transform a sentence into a yes/no question by adding an auxiliary verb at the beginning (e.g., "You went to the store" becomes "Did you go to the store?").
    - Contextual questions: Use contextual cues to generate questions. For example, if a sentence mentions a location, you can generate a question about that location.

7. **Post-proocessions:** Once you generate the questions, you may need to perform some post-processing steps to improve the quality or readability. This could involve removing duplicate questions, filtering out questions that don't make sense, or adjusting the question structure.

8. **Evaluation and Refinement:**  Evaluate the generated questions against some criteria (e.g., relevance, grammaticality) and refine your question generation algorithm as needed. This step is iterative and involves testing the program with different inputs to ensure the quality of the generated questions.

The steps are discussed in details in their own separate files.

*It's worth noting that question generation is a complex task, and the above steps provide a general framework. Implementing each step may involve using various NLP libraries or models, such as tokenizers, sentence segmenters, POS taggers, NER models, and dependency parsers. You can explore existing NLP libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, or Hugging Face's Transformers, which offer pre-trained models for some of these tasks.*
